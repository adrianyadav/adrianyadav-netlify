message: "I'm happy to welcome you! \r\n \r\nSending newsletters via contact forms to the sites ofcompanies via all domain zones of the world in any languages.  \r\n \r\nwebsite =» xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai \r\n \r\nWHAT IS THE MAILING OF WEBSITES BY FEEDBACK FORMS? \r\nThis is a type of mailing using the feedback forms that are located in the contact section of the website and filled by our programme in a preset mode with a rate of a few thousand contact forms per 1 minute, while the alphanumeric code from the pictures (CAPTCHA) is also solved. \r\nAfter that, the letters including your cooperation offers are sent to the mailboxes of firms. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact contact forms, it turns out that each website sends a letter to its own e-mail and, therefore, all messages arrive in the inbox of the exact e-mail address in which the organisation is ready to receive the commercial information. \r\n \r\nUnique Trade Offer: \r\nFast 100-percent informing of organisations and site owners about new business offers. \r\nSearch of new customers that other types of advertisements cannot find. \r\n \r\nTHE MAIN AIM: \r\nFinding new customers that cannot be found through other advertisements. \r\n \r\nBenefits: \r\n1.one hundred percent delivery of business offers. \r\n2.Expansion of the customer base. \r\n3. Increase of the market segment. \r\n4.Regionality and topic orientated mailings. \r\n5. Sending information to company officials. \r\n6. Demand study. \r\n7. Conducting marketing research. \r\n8. Studying public opinion and conducting surveys. \r\n9. High-speed notification. \r\n10. Cost. \r\n11. Entering the international markets. \r\n \r\nUndeniable advantages: \r\n1.When sending mailing by feedback forms, all e-mails arrive in the inbox folder. When sending e-mail newsletters, this can reach up to five percent. \r\n \r\n2.When sending mailing by contact forms it is possible to send a few million e-mails per 24 hours to inbox folders. When sending e-newsletters a few thousands arrive in the inboxes, the rest often either do not reach or arrive in the junk. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by feedback forms a letter does not get blocked by mails because it is sent from different sites. When sending bulk e-mails it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is done will be in \"BAN\". \r\n \r\n4. When sending mailing by feedback forms the very little amount of macro-synonims is used to form text and headings of the letter. When sending bulk e-mails, it is necessary to use «macros» (synonyms) for each word and create ten thousand various headings. \r\n \r\n5. A lot of organisations try to hide their electronic address and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending e-mail newsletters, your commercial offer is delivered to every employee of the firm, (which causes irritation) compared to mailing by feedback forms where the letter is received at the e-mail specifically set up for business offers. \r\n \r\n7.50% of business e-mails are located on free e-mail servers, they are badly \"searchable\" by e-mail, but when sending mailing by feedback forms through these mail servers, all letters are one hundred percent delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only 30%-40% of firms get into the directories within two-three years, and the rest are already located in our WHOIS databases and are waiting for your business offers. \r\nIt turns out that that mailboxes of organisations from directories are full of spam, and therefore they will not have such monetisation as when sending mailing by feedback forms using our new WHOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the body or headings of the message can be sent through feedback forms. When sending bulk e-mails, such messages either are not delivered the recipient or end up in junk. \r\nThe list of stop words of mails includes almost all phrases and words that encourage potential customers to take actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1. Increasing the customer base. \r\n2. Quick informing of marketplaces about new commercial offers. \r\n3. Informing company officials. \r\n4.Supply. \r\n5. Conducting tenders. \r\n6.Conducting marketing campaigns. \r\n7.Conducting surveys and studying public opinion. \r\n8. Searching for clients in other countries. \r\n \r\nReasons for purchasing this service: \r\n \r\n1. one hundred percent delivery of your letters and cooperation offers to millions of businesses all over the globe. \r\nEvery website sends a letter to itself so all filters of mail systems are bypassed. \r\n \r\n2.Mailing by feedback forms is an great way in in terms of conducting all sorts of marketing researches, studies and surveys of  public opinion on differenttype of activity and direction. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact forms, you will be sure that your message has been delivered to one hundred percent of consumers of your product and service and if a product or service is \"badly promoted\", then the potential issue lies in other things, for example in pricing. \r\nAt the same time, within 7 days you will see demand for your own services and products, you will not have to spend money on renting premises and other more time-consuming and expensive marketing activities. \r\n \r\n3.Mailing by contact forms is the quickest and the most economical way to get your service or product to the markets of other countries. \r\n \r\n4. Mailing by feedback forms is a tool for conducting all sorts of tenders. \r\n \r\n5.Daily update of the databases, as more than one hundred and fifty thousand new websites, are registered all over the world every day, and you, in turn, get new potential clients. \r\n \r\n6. Full geographical coverage for all states of the world. \r\n \r\n7. We offer customers that you will not find through other advertisement. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact forms, you will be able to reach out that part of your clientele, that is impossible to \"break through\" automatically in any other way. \r\nFor instance, you will be able to send a commercial offer to those potential clients that were previously unavailable due to filters of mail systems while sending e-mail newsletters. \r\nIn the markets, there is a very paradoxical situation: companies that got into the directories are literally spammed with all sorts of cooperation offers while very little or no e-mails are sent to the remaining ones. \r\n \r\n8. Unique technology of decoding the CAPTCHA. \r\nThere are special services for solving numeric and alphabetic code (captcha/CAPTCHA). It costs one dollar to solve thousand CAPTCHAs. \r\nIt turns out that, processing one million websites the program decodes a million captchas, which costs thousand $ only to solve captcha/CAPTCHA, and we provide this free for you! \r\n \r\n9. By ordering mailing by feedback forms, you are promoting your product or service not to separate people, but to entire collectives, for example domain zone .com, where more than one hundred and fifty million commercial  organisations from all over the world are accumulated (we have got samples of them from international zones for every state). \r\n \r\n10. Mailing by feedback forms also includes a type of SMS mailing \r\nEmail that is linked to the feedback form is the main email of companies through which orders and business offers are sent. This e-mail is also set up for cell phones as it is necessary to respond to the messages very fast so as not to lose the order or the relevance of the business offer. \r\n \r\n11. The base of every country also includes all joint companies from all countries of the world closely related to or working with this country, for instance, diasporas and national communities. \r\nSanctions of search engines and mail systems? \r\nThese mailings are an alternative to sending mass e-mails, therefore search engine sanctions and \"BAN\" do not apply to them. \r\nThe mail system delivers the data of messages to the inbox folder, as it moves through the \"warm e-mail channel\" from the new IP address of the site to the corporate e-mail of the same website. \r\nSimply speaking, these mailings \"live in e-mails\" and mail filters do not react to them, because mails have a certain trust in communication channels between internet resources and corporate e-mail addresses. \r\n \r\nOUR DATABASES: \r\nYou can buy our databases separately from the mailing by sending us a enquiry by feedback form. \r\n \r\nMORE THAN TWO THOUSAND WHOIS DATABASES BY DOMAINS AND COUNTRIES. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CONTINENTS. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN LANGUAGES. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CMS. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. \r\n \r\nHOW TO MAKE AN PROMOTIONAL OFFER FOR MAILING BY FEEDBACK FORMS: \r\nThe simplest text + headings, the main goal is to interest the future customer, and they will read the rest on your site. \r\nMost likely, all ads on your subject are already on the Internet, enter the necessary requests into the search bar and choose the most successful ones. \r\nThe headings are substituted replacing each other from text file. \r\nOnly text messages are sent, links are inserted without problems, they are all \"clickable\". If the future customer needs pictures or more detailed information, then you should forward the client to visit your site. \r\n \r\nIn the letter: \r\nText without pictures, since pictures do not pass through the feedback form. \r\nYour contact details: \r\nSite address: \r\n \r\nFields to fill in: \r\nName: \r\nCountry: \r\nCity: \r\nInternet resource: \r\nSeveral headings: \r\nE-mail for autoresponces: \r\n \r\nwebsite =» xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai \r\nPrice List =» xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai/en/price/"
