I"v<p>Everything that is made has one objective: grab your attention. The messages your friend sends you on facebook, the emails you receive from your colleagues, the posters you see as you walk to the station. Everything is fighting for your attention. Not only is everything fighting for your attention, everything is <strong>designed</strong> to capture your attention.</p>
