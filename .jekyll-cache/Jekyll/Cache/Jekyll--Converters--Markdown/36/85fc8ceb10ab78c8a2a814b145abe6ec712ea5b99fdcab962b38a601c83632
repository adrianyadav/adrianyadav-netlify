I"=<p>I think one of the most important skills a person can have is the ability to break up a large task into smaller bits. We canâ€™t jump into the hard stuff right away - we need to ease ourselves into it. When we achieve a small task, we get into the rhythm and this makes transitioning into harder tasks easier.</p>
