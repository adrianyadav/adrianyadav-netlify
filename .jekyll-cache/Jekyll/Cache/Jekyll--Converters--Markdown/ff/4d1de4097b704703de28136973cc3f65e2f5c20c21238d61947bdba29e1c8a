I"H<p>If you had all the resources available you needed to reach your goal - would you fulfil your dreams? Logic says yes. If my dream was to be a chess player - and I had grandmasters, coaches, facilities to support me from an early age then surely I would be able to achieve the dream. However, this isnâ€™t always the case.</p>
