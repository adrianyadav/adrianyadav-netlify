title: Creating a blog with Jekyll + Netlify CMS part 1
---
I've always wonder what the best way to create a blog is from a developer experience as well as a client one. Wordpress for me was too much out of the box and a lot of stuff I didn't really need. I stumbled upon using Jekyll (a static blog generator) with Netlify CMS (headless CMS) and am loving  how easy and intuitive everything is.

In this series, we will be making a blog editable via Netlify CMS.

The final product will look like: <http://adrianyadav-blog.netlify.com/> and we will make every bit of content on the page editable via an admin interface **Netlify** provides.
