title: 3 Life changing books

I hesitate to use "**Life-changing**" as it is way too casually thrown out but it is definitely applicable here. While I was traveling, I was looking for a few audio books to digest on the flight(s) and came across these three books.

## 1. Why We Sleep - By Matthew Walker

If you are not getting 8-9 hours of quality (uninterrupted) sleep on a daily basis - then you need to make a change. 

Sleep is the **greatest** performance enhancer we have available to us - why not make the most use of it? 

Top athletes like LeBron James, Usain Bolt, Roger Federer - routinely get 8-12 hours of sleep on a daily basis. The book explains in detail how sleep benefits you and what the downsides are of not getting enough sleep.

Matthew Walker makes a good case for how we don't value sleep on a societal level and this should be considered an epidemic. For example, we respect the CEO that comes to work at 6AM and responds to an email at 1AM and applaud him for how hardworking and dedicated he is but is he efficient as he could be? 

Not necessarily - **bottom line** is you need more quality sleep which will make you do better in every aspect of your life.

## 2. Atomic Habits - By James Clear

> We are what we do.  Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit
>
>  —  Will Durant

The book is a comprehensive guide on how habits are formed, tips on how to make the good ones stay around and remove the bad ones.

When you have a new habit that you want to form, for example: I want to get fit. Then this book will give you the tools to make sure that you can make that habit stick and incorporate it in your daily routine.

## 3. Can't Hurt Me By David Goggins

David Goggins has done some incredible things: become a navy seal, held a record for the most pull ups in a day, completing Badwater-135 Ultra marathon (which is described as world's toughest footrace) - and the list goes on.

It requires an enormous amount of mental strength, fortitude and resilience  to do these things. In this book, David shares what helped him develop the mental strength to push through and overcome any obstacle that came his way or that he put there. 

The main takeaway from this book, is that if you are too comfortable - you need to make a **change**. Being comfortable means you cannot quickly grow as a person. When life gets too easy, add something to make it **difficult**. For example: waking up every day at 6am - when that get's easy, make it harder - go for a run after you wake up.
