title: 3 Life changing books
---
I hesitate to use "Life-changing" as it is way too casually thrown out but I feel the term really applies here. While I was exploring europe, I looked for a few audio books to digest (on an unrelated note - I had recently spent $500 on Bose QC35 headphones and they were amazing - I have been buying cheap $20 earphones every couple of months for long as I remember). These books made a huge measurable impact one and I wanted to share the ideas.

1. **Why We Sleep** - By Matthew Walker

I'll summarise this book in one sentenance - if you are not getting 8-9 hours of quality (interupted) sleep on a daily basis - then you really and I mean **really** need change your habits. Sleep is the greatest performance enhancer we have available to us - why not make the most use of it? Top athletes like LeBron James, Usain Bolt, Roger Federer - routinely get 8-12 hourrs of sleep on a daily basis. The book explains in detail how sleep benefits you and what the ramifications are of not getting enough of sleep. Matthew Walker makes a good case for how we don't value sleep on a societial level - and this has to change. For example, we respect the CEO that comes to work at 5AM and checks his email at @2AM - and think wow he is so hard working - but is he efficient? Not necessarily - bottom line is you need to sleep.
