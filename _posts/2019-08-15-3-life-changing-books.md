## Sleep, Habits and Resilence

I hesitate to use "**Life-changing**" as it is way too casually thrown out but I feel the term really applies here. While I was traveling, I looked for a few audio books to digest on the flight. These three books made a huge measurable impact on me.

**Why We Sleep - By Matthew Walker**

I'll summarise this book in one sentence - if you are not getting 8-9 hours of quality (uninterrupted) sleep on a daily basis - then you need to make a change. Sleep is the greatest performance enhancer we have available to us - why not make the most use of it? Top athletes like LeBron James, Usain Bolt, Roger Federer - routinely get 8-12 hours of sleep on a daily basis. The book explains in detail how sleep benefits you and what the downsides  are of not getting enough sleep (even just losing one hour has a measurable impact). Matthew Walker makes a good case for how we don't value sleep on a societal level and how it should be considered an epidemic. For example, we respect the CEO that comes to work at 6AM and responds to an email at 1AM and applaud him for how hardworking and dedicated he is but is he efficient? Not necessarily - bottom line is you need more quality sleep and this will make you do better in every aspect of your life.

**Atomic Habits - By James Clear**

> We are what we do.  Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit

\- **Will Durant**

The book is a comprehensive guide on how habits are formed, tips on how to make the good ones stay around and remove the bad ones - and generally how to get 1% better everyday.

When you have a new (hopefully good) habit that you want to form for example: I want to get fit. This book will give you the tools to make sure that you can make exercise a habit and have it stick.

**Can't Hurt Me By David Goggins**

David Goggins has done some incredible things: become a navy seal, held a record for the most pull ups in a day, completing Badwater-135 Ultra marathon (which is described as world's toughest footrace) - and many more. It requires an enormous amount of mental strength, fortitude and resilience  to do these things. In this book, David goes through his life and shares what helped him develop the mental strength to push through and overcome any obstacle that came his way or that he put there. The main takeaway was that if you are too comfortable - you need to make a change. Being comfortable means you cannot grow as a person, when life gets too easy - add some thing to make it difficult. For example: waking up every day at 6am and going for a run - when that get's easy, make it harder,
