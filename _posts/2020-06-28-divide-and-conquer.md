I think one of the most important skills a person can have is the ability to break up a large task into smaller bits. When we achieve a small task, we get into the rhythm and which makes the next task less daunting.

The reason why you should make your bed in the morning is that it's a small task which helps build momentum: you start your day already having accomplished something early. If you can't make your bed in the morning then something harder like going to the gym in the morning is going to be impossible.

I think starting your day with micro tasks, making your bed, doing a 1min breathing exercise, reading a paragraph of a book etc helps build solid momentum and allows you to tackle harder tasks with a good mindset.

Often, when we think of a project  (assignment, construction, app etc) - it seems a bit daunting. For example, if I have a 2500 word assignment - my brain automatically thinks what a massive amount of effort it's going to take, which means I'll put it off until the last possible moment. 

However if I reframe my thinking, it becomes a bit easier. Let's say I have 10 days before the assignment is due - that is roughly 250 words each day (which doesn't seem to be bad).  But even then the procrastination kicks in and before I know it, I'll have to do 2500 words in one day. 

While, thinking of the assignment in 250 words per day helped - it didn't exactly help me start the assignment. This is because the 250 word goal wasn't very specific and my brain thinks that even 250 words is too much effort to start with. Once, I get into the flow - I can probably smash out 500-1000 words in a few hours no problems - the problem is getting into the flow to begin with.

So let's think of another way to break down the project.

1. Reading the assignment 
2. Reading an article or research paper related to the assignment
3. Research (finding 4 sources of credited information that has opposing viewpoints related to the assignment)
4. Writing the key ideas I want to focus on
5. Crafting an abstract/intro (250 words)
6. Writing the first key idea with appropriate citations
7. Writing the second main bit of the body
8. Conclusion
9. Read the marketing criteria
10. Reflect on what I wrote, does it match the marketing criteria?
11. Review - Grammar/Spelling
12. Review - does it flow well? make sense?
13. Review - does it make sense to a person not studying this paper?
14. Enhancements
15. Submission

So here, I just broke the assignment into 15 steps. During the initial bit, the tasks are fairly simple: day 1 - Read the assignment, day 2 - Read an article of research etc. During the middle it ramps up (as I would have gotten into the flow) and by the end the workload decreases.

What's also important here is, that each step  is very specific and not vague (write 250 words). It's easy for me to start the assignment and as I tick the parts, I gain a small victory which helps me flow to the next bit.

If you are able to break down a project in to small and achievable units of work(s) then you can trick your mind into doing something it doesn't initially want to.
